Jsonie Framework
================
Lightweight and fast JSON encoding/decoding framework written in Visual Basic .NET. Library is designed to be super easy to use.


Status
------
JSON encoding/decoding should be fully working. Currently I work on polishing API to be simple, easy to use, unambiguous, non-misleading and united. Also I'm introducing `JsonDynamic` type.

Library is in **alpha** version.
